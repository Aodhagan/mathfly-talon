# Talon command set for dictating mathematics

A command set for the [talon](https://talonvoice.com/) voice control system that allows you to dictate mathematics into the [LyX](https://www.lyx.org/) or [Scientific Notebook 5.5](https://www.mackichan.com/index.html?products/dnloadreq55.html~mainFrame) document processors. See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_E-Ys16r4D0) by [ma-anwar](https://github.com/ma-anwar) for an introduction and demonstration.

If you are new to all of this, start by following the [talon getting started guide](https://talonvoice.com/docs/). Once you have talon installed follow the [knausj_talon getting started guide](https://github.com/knausj85/knausj_talon#getting-started-with-talon) to familiarise yourself with the basic commands, including the phonetic alphabet. The learning curve here is quite steep, but it is worth persevering, as this is by far the most efficient and powerful way to control a computer by voice.

Once you are set up and comfortable with talon, download or clone this repository into your user folder to add maths commands. To get started, say the `help maths` command while in LyX or Scientific Notebook for instructions and a list of available commands.

If you have any problems with getting set up or using these scripts, feel free to ask for help in the [#maths channel on the talon slack](https://app.slack.com/client/T7FPSMV8F/C01ETRZNT46).
