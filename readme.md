# WIP - Talon command set for dictating mathematics

If you are using the [knausj](https://github.com/knausj85/knausj_talon) command set, just copy the `mathfly` directory into your talon user directory.

Open up [LyX](https://www.lyx.org/) and try saying:
* new file
* math mode
* integral plex squared equals one third plex cubed
